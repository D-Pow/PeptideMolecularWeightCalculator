# PeptideMolecularWeightCalculator

Calculates the molecular weight of a peptide sequence. Includes additional compounds useful for solid-phase synthesis: Fmoc (fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride, a common protecting group), Nap (2-naphthoic acid), tyrosine-phosphate (Yp), and an ester compound (formed by the reaction between succinamide + ethanolamine). Written in Python.
